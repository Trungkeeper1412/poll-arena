# Poll Arena

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

PollArena is a simple application that can help users create and participate in multiple polls together.

PollArena this project allows me (as a learner) to apply state management fundamentals using Redux I've learned from the course such as :

- Create a one-way data flow with Redux store (as a giant state that acts like a single source of truth), and changing the state with dispatch and reducers
- Manifest the action creators pattern to create a more controllable method with changing the state
- Apply simple middlewares such as a logger for state and action change and Redux Thunk
- Using @testing-library/react and Jest to create some simple unit tests

## Installation
